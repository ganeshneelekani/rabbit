Building simple test application using Clojure and RabbitMQ

This application is a RabbitMQ client that performs basic messaging operations, such as sending and receiving messages. It has been integrated with Pedestal and Langohr libraries to enhance its functionality and performance. The Pedestal integration enables the application to handle HTTP requests and responses, while the Langohr integration provides a Clojure API for interacting with RabbitMQ. Together, these integrations make it easier to build robust and scalable messaging applications. There is still lot to be done as part of this application concurrency and applying ROC
